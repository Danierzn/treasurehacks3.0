# Daily Challenges App
  This is our submission to the 2023 [Treasure Hacks 3.0 Hackathon](https://treasure-hacks-3-0.devpost.com/). The given theme of the competition was "Life is a game", so we decided to create a "game" that benefits the lives of other people by giving them daily challenges every day they log in, so they could get out there and make a difference by completing these goals.

# Inspiration
  Our group consists of coding amateurs, and since this was our first Hackathon, we wanted to challenge ourselves with something really out of our comfort zone. We decided to work with Python and use the TKinter library to create our GUI for our app. We combined it with some minimal knowledge on SQL and databases which stores the daily challenges the app asks the user.

# What it Does
  Our app, "UNDECIDED NAME", will be a simple, easy-to-use, executable that prompts the user a quote when user asks. There is a point system which racks up based on the amount of goals successfully finished every day. 

# Installing
  To install the executable, click here "INPUT LINK LATER". The source code for all of the elements is available on this repository.
